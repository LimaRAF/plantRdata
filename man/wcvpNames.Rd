\description{
A dataset containing the most relevant taxonomic
information of plant names stored in the \href{https://powo.science.kew.org/}{World Checklist of Vascular Plants},
taxonomic backbone including vascular plants (i.e. licophytes,
ferns, gymnosperms and angiosperms) and taxonomic levels up to
genus level (i.e. infra-species, species and genus). WCVP
currently has no information on family and order names or
Bryophytes. \cr\cr The original backbone was edited aiming to
standardize the notation across backbones in \code{plantRdata}. Many
columns in the original source that were not essential for the
process of taxon name checking were removed and most of them were
renamed. Duplicated scientific names (i.e. taxon name + author)
whose taxon status were not accepted were also removed to avoid
possible problems in the taxon name matching process. \cr\cr The
original column with the taxonomic status was simplified to macth
other backbones and have the following categories: accepted,
synonyms, unplaced and blank (i.e. empty status). Original
categories 'Artificial Hybrid', 'Local Biotype' and
'Orthographic' were converted to 'accepted', 'accepted' and
'synonym', excepted when the nomenclatural remarks suggested
otherwise. Other original categories (i.e. Illegitimate, Invalid
and Misapplied) were left as blanks. All original categories were
moved to the nomenclatural remarks column for consistency. For
WCVP, the original nomenclatural remarks was very rich
information but it had to be simplified to facilitate the
understanding of the output of name matching process to the final
users.
