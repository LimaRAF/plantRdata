\description{
A dataset containing the most relevant taxonomic
information of plant names stored in the \href{https://powo.science.kew.org/}{World Checklist of Vascular Plants},
taxonomic backbone including vascular plants (i.e. licophytes,
ferns, gimnosperms and angiosperms) and all taxonomic levels
(i.e. infra-species, species, genus, family and so on).
Bryophytes are not included. \cr\cr The original backbone was
slightly edited aiming to standardize the notation across
backbones provided in \code{plantRdata}. Many columns in the original
source that were not essential for the process of taxon name
checking were removed and most of them were renamed. Duplicated
scientific names (i.e. taxon name + author) whose taxon status
were not accepted were also removed to avoid possible problems in
the taxon name matching process.
