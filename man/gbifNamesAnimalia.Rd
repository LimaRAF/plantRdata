\description{
A dataset containing the most relevant taxonomic
information of the kingdom Animalia stored in the
\href{https://www.gbif.org/}{Global Biodiversity Information Facility},
taxonomic backbone, including all taxonomic levels (i.e.
infra-species, species, genus, family and so on).\cr\cr The
original backbone was slightly edited aiming to standardize the
notation across backbones provided in \code{plantRdata}. Many columns
in the original source that were not essential for the process of
taxon name checking were removed and most of them were renamed.
Duplicated scientific names (i.e. taxon name + author) whose
taxon status were not accepted were also removed to avoid
possible problems in the taxon name matching process.
