\description{
A dataset containing the most relevant taxonomic
information of the animals stored in
the \href{http://fauna.jbrj.gov.br/fauna/listaBrasil}{Taxonomic Catalog of the Brazilian Fauna}
backbone. It includes all taxonomic levels (i.e. infra-species,
species, genus, family and so on).\cr\cr The original backbone
was slightly edited aiming to standardize the notation across all
backbones in \code{plantRdata}. Many columns in the original source
that were not essential for the process of taxon name checking
were removed and most of them were renamed. Duplicated scientific
names (i.e. taxon name + author) whose taxon status were not
accepted were also removed to avoid possible problems in the
taxon name matching process.
